# The Summit #

"Your goal is to improve the user experience of this ski lodge landing page. Currently, none of the clickable elements are very clear or offer good visual feedback to users.

The exact implementation and styling will be up to you; take the opportunity to be creative in your designs! Keep in mind that slick styling is cool, but it is just as important to clearly demonstrate to users how to interact with the site."

## Suggested Objectives ##

**Basic Link Styling**
1. Start by creating some basic link color highlighting and hover state styling for all `<a>` tags.
2. Style the `.nav-link` elements at the top of the page so that they show clickability.

**Styling Buttons**
3. Style the main "get on the mountain" button. It is up to you whether to opt for a more skeuomorphic or flat design, or whether you want to try to blend between the two.
4. Create `:hover` and `:active` styles for the `.btn` class.

**Activity Buttons**
5. Show clickability for the large activity buttons at the bottom of the page. You may also alter or update their basic styling if you'd like to take a more skeuomorphic design approach.
6. Create hover and active states for the activity buttons. Make sure you are demonstrating good visual feedback to show the different states.

### Extra Credit ###
Try using CSS transitions to ease between style-states. This is optional but can help make more seamless, animated effects.
